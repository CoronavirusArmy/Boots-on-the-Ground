# Boots-on-the-Ground

## PROBLEM
We love Helpboards/FacebookGroups/invisibleshandsdeliver.com, but we anticipate a huge scaling problem. In 2 weeks, the numby of need requests is going to increase by 100 to 1000X. We believe most matching systems will grind to a halt.

## SOLUTION
We don't want to make a new app.  We want simple services.

Actually, best way to get started is to go here (Discord https://discord.gg/vuNVr8H) and look at the #boots channels. Sorry... We are changing every 12 hours, so hard to keep the documentation up.

* Tech Team is about 8. Non Tech team about 8-15.
* Juniors
* Midlevel front end (angular, or bootstrap, or whatever/agnostic)
* Backend 
  * ("babyAPI" with no security to get the front end mocked up), and
  * bulletproof API with google realtime Database for 100,000-10,000,000 users.
